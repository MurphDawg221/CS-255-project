Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the system is DriverPass the DriverPass system is meant to be a software for users to help practice for their driving exams.
The system provides training packages so that users can prepare a way they feel necessary. DriverPass hopes to take advantage of the this 
area in the market and boosting the pass rate for users taking their driving exams all around the U.S., It is a growing system so it will 
reamin as updated as possible to assist users in their learning experience and remain as current as possible with the information being provided.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt my diagrams where fairly easy to follow and demonstrates basic system functions required that the client was asking for. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would definetly like to revise the login activity diagram and add the security aspect discussed for if the user type the wrong password
to many times. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs through use case diagrams to help give me an idea of how the system should work for the users. This allowed me to be able to 
get a better idea of the functional requirements that need to happen to which I was able to create more diagrams to picture the system from the users and 
clients prospective. It is important to consider the users needs when designing because they are ultimately the ones paying the client to use their system, 
and they need to be able to use and navigate that system appropriately. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The approach taken was through the use of agile development methods. Gantt charts were used to establish hard timelines for development. Use case diagrams where
used to help visualize the system from the prospective of the users needs. Uml diagrams where used to show the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the 
system and activity diagrams where used to outline the way main functions of the system should operate. Activity diagrams made it easy to visualize the code necessary
to make that area of the system function the way it needs too.
